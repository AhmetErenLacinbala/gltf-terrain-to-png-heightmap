# gltf terrain model to png heightmap file

Nothing fancy. Turn your gltf terrain file to a png grayscale heightmap.

## Tutorial
- Download nodejs.
- Use gltf embedded, don't use bin or glb.
- Export only the terrain; the file must contain only the terrain.
- Terrain has to be a rectangle.

## API Refference
There is no API reference lmao. just use following command.
```
node node.js <input gltf> <output png (optional)>
```
