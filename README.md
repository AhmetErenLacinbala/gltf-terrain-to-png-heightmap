# gltf terrain model to png heightmap file

Nothing fancy. Turn your gltf terrain file to a png grayscale heightmap.

## Tutorial
- Download nodejs.
- Use gltf embedded, don't use bin or glb.
- Export only the terrain; the file must contain only the terrain.
- Terrain has to be a rectangle.

## API Reference
There is no API reference lmao. just use following command.
```
node node.js <path/to/your/gltf> <path/to/your/desired/png/output/but/this/is/optional>
```
